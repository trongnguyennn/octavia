    Fixed an issue with the ``lo`` interface in the ``amphora-haproxy`` network
    namespace. The ``lo`` interface was down and prevented haproxy to
    communicate with other haproxy processes (for persistent stick tables) on
    configuration change. It delayed old haproxy worker cleanup and increased
    the memory consumption usage after reloading the configuration.
