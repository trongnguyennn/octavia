    Fixes loadbalancer creation failure when one of the listener port matches
    with the octavia generated peer ports and the allowed_cidr is explicitly
    set to 0.0.0.0/0 on the listener. This is due to creation of two security
    group rules with remote_ip_prefix as None and remote_ip_prefix as 0.0.0.0/0
    which neutron rejects the second request with security group rule already
    exists.
