    Fix an issue when Octavia performs a failover of an ACTIVE-STANDBY load
    balancer that has both amphorae missing.
    Some tasks in the controller took too much time to timeout because the
    timeout value defined in
    ``[haproxy_amphora].active_connection_max_retries`` and
    ``[haproxy_amphora].active_connection_rety_interval`` was not used.
