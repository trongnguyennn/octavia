    Fix an issue with amphorav2 and persistence, some long tasks executed by a
    controller might have been released in taskflow and rescheduled on another
    controller. Octavia now ensures that a task is never released early by
    using a keepalive mechanism to notify taskflow (and its redis backend) that
    a job is still running.
