    The load balancer create command now accepts an availability_zone argument.
    With the amphora driver this will create a load balancer in the targeted
    compute availability_zone in nova.

    When using spare pools, it will create spares in each AZ. For the amphora
    driver, if no ``[nova] availability_zone`` is configured and availability
    zones are used, results may be slightly unpredictable.

    Note (for the ``amphora`` driver): if it is possible for an amphora to
    change availability zone after initial creation (not typically possible
    without outside intervention) this may affect the ability of this feature
    to function properly.
