deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[amphora_agent].agent_server_network_file`` configuration option is
    now deprecated, the new Amphora network configuration tool introduced in
    Xena does not support a single configuration file.
fixes:
  - |
    Amphora network configuration for the VIP interface and the pool member
    interfaces are now applied with the amphora-interface tool.
    amphora-interface uses pyroute2 low-level functions to configure the
    interfaces instead of distribution-specific tools such as "network-scripts"
    or "/etc/network/interfaces" files.
