    HTTPS-terminated listeners can now be individually configured with an OpenSSL cipher string.
    The default cipher string for new listeners can be specified with ``default_tls_ciphers``
    in ``octavia.conf``. The built-in default is OWASP's "Suite B" recommendation. (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/TLS_Cipher_String_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    Existing listeners will be unaffected.
