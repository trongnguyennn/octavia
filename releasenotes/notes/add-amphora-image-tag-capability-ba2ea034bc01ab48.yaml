    Operators can now use the 'amp_image_tag' Octavia flavor capability when
    using the amphora provider driver. This allows custom amphora images to be
    used per-load balancer. If this is not defined in an Octavia flavor, the
    amp_image_tag Octavia configuration file setting will continue to be used.
