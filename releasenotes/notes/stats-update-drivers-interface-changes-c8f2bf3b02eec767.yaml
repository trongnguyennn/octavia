features:
  - |
    Loadbalancer statistics can now be reported to multiple backend locations
    simply by specifying multiple statistics drivers in config.
upgrade:
  - |
    The internal interface for loadbalancer statistics collection has moved.
    When upgrading, see deprecation notes for the ``stats_update_driver``
    config option, as it will need to be moved and renamed.
deprecations:
  - |
    The option ``health_manager.health_update_driver`` has been deprecated as
    it was never really used, so the driver layer was removed.
    The option ``health_manager.stats_update_driver`` was moved and renamed
    to ``controller_worker.statistics_drivers`` (note it is now plural). It
    can now contain a list of multiple drivers for handling statistics.
