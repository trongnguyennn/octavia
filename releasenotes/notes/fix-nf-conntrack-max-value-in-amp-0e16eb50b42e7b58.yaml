    The fix that updates the Netfilter Conntrack Sysfs variables requires
    rebuilding the amphora image in order to be effective.
fixes:
  - |
    Netfilter Conntrack Sysfs variables net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max and
    nf_conntrack_expect_max get set to sensible values on the amphora now.
    Previously, kernel default values were used which were much too low for the
    configured net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_buckets value. As a result packets
    could get dropped because the conntrack table got filled too quickly. Note
    that this affects only UDP and SCTP protocol listeners.
    Connection tracking is disabled for TCP-based connections on the
    amphora including HTTP(S).
