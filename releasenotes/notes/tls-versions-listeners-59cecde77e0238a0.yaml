features:
  - |
    HTTPS-terminated listeners can now be configured to use only specified
    versions of TLS.  Default TLS versions for new listeners can be set with
    ``default_listener_tls_versions`` in ``octavia.conf``.  Existing listeners
    will continue to use the old defaults.
upgrade:
  - |
    HTTPS-terminated listeners will now only allow TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 by
    default. If no TLS versions are specified at listener create time, the
    listener will only accept TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 connections. Previously TLS
    listeners would accept any TLS version. Existing listeners will not be
    changed.
