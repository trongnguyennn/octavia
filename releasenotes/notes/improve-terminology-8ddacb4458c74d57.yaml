deprecations:
  - |
    Terminology such as ``blacklist`` has been replaced with more
    inclusive words, such as ``prohibit list`` wherever possible.

    The configuration option ``tls_cipher_blacklist`` has been deprecated
    and replaced with ``tls_cipher_prohibit_list``. It will be removed in a
    future release.
