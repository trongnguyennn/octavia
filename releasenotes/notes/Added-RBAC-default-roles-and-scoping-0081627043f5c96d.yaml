features:
  - |
    Added support for keystone default roles and system token scopes.
upgrade:
  - |
    Legacy Octavia Advanced RBAC policies will continue to function as before
    as long as the [oslo_policy] enforce_scope = False and
    enforce_new_defaults = False settings are present (this is the current
    oslo.policy default). However, we highly recommend you update your
    user roles to follow the new keystone default roles and start using scoped
    tokens as appropriate.
    See the `Octavia Policies
    <https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/configuration/policy.html>`_
    administration guide for more information.
deprecations:
  - |
    Legacy Octavia Advanced RBAC policies without the keystone default roles
    and/or token scoping are deprecated as of the Wallaby release.
    The oslo.policy project may change the default settings requiring the
    keystone default roles and scoped tokens in a future release. Please see
    the upgrade section in these release notes and the `Octavia Policies
    <https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/configuration/policy.html>`_
    administration guide for more information.
