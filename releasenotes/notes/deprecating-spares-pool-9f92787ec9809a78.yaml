    Spares pool support is deprecated, pending removal in the X release. Use of
    the spares pool was originally recommended to increase provisioning speed,
    but since Nova's server groups do not support adding existing VMs, Octavia
    cannot support use of the spares pool with the Active-Standby topology.
    Since this is our recommended topology for production deployments, and
    speed is less essential in development/testing environments (the only place
    we could recommend the use of Single topology), the overhead of maintaining
    spares pool support exceeds its theoretical usefulness.
