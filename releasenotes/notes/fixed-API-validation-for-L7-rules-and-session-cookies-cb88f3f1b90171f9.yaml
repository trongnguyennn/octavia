    Fixed validations in L7 rule and session cookie APIs in order to prevent
    authenticated and authorized users to inject code into HAProxy
    configuration. CR and LF (\\r and \\n) are no longer allowed in L7 rule
    keys and values. The session persistence cookie names must follow the rules
    described in
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie.
