    Added a new configuration setting (``[task_flow]/jobboard_enabled``) to
    enable/disable jobboard functionality in the amphorav2 provider. When
    disabled, the amphorav2 provider behaves similarly to the amphora v1
    provider and does not require extra dependencies. The default setting is
    jobboard disabled while jobboard remains an experimental feature.
